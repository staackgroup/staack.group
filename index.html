              <h3> Penetration Testing </h3>
              <p>Penetration tests are critical to gaining a clear understanding of your organization‚Äôs gaps in security, the impact if those gaps are exploited, and knowledge of how to prioritize risks and deficiencies quickly and effectively. A penetration test engagement facilitates overall risk reduction within your specific environment in a structured, efficient way by uncovering real vulnerabilities and threats to your organization's assets, intellectual property, and customer data.</p>
              <p>By working tightly with your team, Staack Group leverages proprietary tools, methodologies, and years of experience to identify vulnerabilities that would otherwise not be easily detected, understood or prioritized by automated scanners and non-exhaustive searches.</p>
              <p>Post-engagement tangibles include a list of vulnerabilities, impacted assets, and risk evaluations associated with each specific vulnerability. Staack Group leverages unique industry knowledge and couples it with context, providing your organization with a gap analysis geared to strategically eliminate risks.</p>
              <p>Our vast arsenal of intrusion methods are available at your discretion (including social engineering). All penetration testing services are adapted to fit your organization‚Äôs needs.</p>

              <h3> Secure Code Review </h3>
              <p>A secure code review is an effective way to identify, mitigate and manage security weakness within your organization's web application. Our secure code review process focuses on identifying and mitigating insecure coding practices that may lead to application security vulnerabilities.</p>
              <p>Staack Group has several years of experience conducting secure code reviews on key software technologies (including Java, .NET, PHP, Python, and JavaScript) using a defined and structured process.</p>
              <p>Our secure code review process includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Review of the application's architecture and source code</li>
                <li>Identification of security vulnerabilities within the application's design</li>
                <li>Identification of security vulnerabilities within the source code of the application</li>
                <li>Recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the identified insecure coding practices</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Our team can perform both automated and detailed manual review of the application's source code, at your discretion. Post-engagement tangibles include a list of prioritized vulnerabilities, risk evaluations associated with each specific vulnerability, and technical control recommendation to mitigate the vulnerabilities detected.</p>
